You shut the door behind you
Telling me, I'm not the person
I used to be perhaps an apology ain't enough
When everying is so messed up

Good things will happen to good people
I think I must have done something terrible
The cake I brought back isn't your flavor
So I alone ate them all

My stomach started to ache
I think it must be the cake I ate
I think it must be mistake I made

I'm losing someone who understand me
I'm losing someone who understand me
Not you, you said

My stomach started to ache
I think it must be the cake I ate
I think it must be mistake I made

I'm losing someone who understand me
I'm losing someone who understand me
I'm losing someone who understand me

Not you, you said
