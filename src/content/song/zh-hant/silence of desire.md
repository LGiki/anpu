silence of plenty love of your motherland
Another year in play to a child of now
Another year in play

Know this horizon of ours
Who's got nothing to tell
You are the faces
You ought to face it
You ought to face this when you turn out cold but high
You are the faces
You ought to face it
You are to be shining so bright
Shining bright
Shining bright

Silence of plenty love of your motherland
Another year in play to a child of now
Know this horizon of ours
Who's got nothing to tell
You are the faces
You ought to face it
You ought to face this when you turn out cold but high
You are the faces
You ought to face it
You are to be shining so bright
Shining bright
Shining bright
you are to be shining so bright
Shining bright
Shining bright
You are to be shining so bright
Shining bright
Shining bright
