I'm not there
And I'd rather than at everywhere in another room
You were not there
When I was giving into rope in another whore

And I'll be held on rather stay than move
When I'll be here into every old downstair
In everywhere and know
We're not the other pray
Gonna stop

Gonna stop
Before it's too late
Gonna stop oh when
You have chained n exchanged ur soul to the sea

I'm not there
And I'd rather than at everywhere in another room
You were not there
When I was giving into rope in another whore

And I'll be held on rather stay than move
When I'll be here into every old downstair
In everywhere and know
We're not the other pray
Gonna stop

Gonna stop
Before it's too late
Gonna stop oh when
You have chained n exchanged ur soul to the sea

In other road they serve
Where am I no ti's in shout
In other way

In other road they serve
Where am i now ti's in prout
In other oven howin-tage

One two three four five n u get a ten
One two three four five n u give someday

In another heaven you and I in heaven damn
And another heart in here wherever walk in the room
Yeah gonna stop

Gonna stop
Before it's too late
Gonna stop oh when
You have chained not that exchanged ur soul to the sea
