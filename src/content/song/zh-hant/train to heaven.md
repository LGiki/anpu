(歌詞暫不完整且可能有誤，需要你的幫助)

Train to heaven is about to arrive
Arrive in some seconds here
Before the notice is about to release
Arriving here somewhere

Train to heaven is about to arrive
Arrive in some seconds here
Before the notice is about to release
Arriving here somewhere

Said yoyo I am ready to go
How do you know before you get used to travel

Train to heaven is about to arrive
Arrive in some seconds here
Before the notice is about to release
Arriving here somewhere

Train to arrive oh the train to heaven
Woo woo ba ba ba
Don't you know the train is about to arrive

Said yoyo I am ready to go
How do you know before you get used to travel
Said yoyo I am ready to go
How do you know before and here and wherever (?)

Train to heaven is about to arrive
Arrive in some seconds here
Before the notice is about to release
Arriving here somewhere

Train to heaven is about to arrive
