Embarrassment under cover of a smile
I see a dark red light
What do you want to hide
Silence instead comes up a knife
Sharp but harmless
What do you want to guard with
Faith murmured in a low voice
Warmth creeping unto your face
Faith murmured in a low voice
Warmth creeping unto your face
I see Mr. Love dancing on the speeding dice
Not knowing which face to reside
I see Mr. Love dancing on the speeding dice
Not knowing which face to
Reside reside re
Woo woo oh

Another cigarette is tipped to the fire
I opened my eyes, gazed at the purple sky
The bus has already arrived
Silence instead comes up a knife
Sharp but harmless
Shat do you want to guard with
Faith murmured in a low voice
Warmth creeping unto your face
Faith murmured in a low voice
Warmth creeping unto your face
I see Mr. Love dancing on the speeding dice
Not knowing which face to reside
I see Mr. Love dancing on the speeding dice
Not knowing which face to
I see Mr. Love dancing on the speeding dice
Not knowing which face to
I see Mr. Love dancing on the speeding dice
Not knowing which face to
Reside reside re
Woo woo oh

Waiting for a joy ride
I'll meet you deep inside
