戏剧散场我回家
公车站牌很远很难到达
握着票根还想着主角说的话

忧郁很短叹息很长
其实有很多想法只是不被表达
我这会儿该担心的是妈妈
现在已快要十二点啦

以为生命就得如此地过去
却难释怀自己自己 需要跳得更强烈的心

So why do you worry me
And why, don't you go to sleep
Aren't you confident that, everyone
Is Okay in the city

Why. Do you worry me
And why don't you go to sleep
I thought I am but simple
So simple to dream

日子该是不同形状
坚持梦想不容易人要努力
可是他说 这种事情迟早得放弃

以为没有能轻松评断对错的真理
我不能释怀自己自己 那颗跳得够强烈的心

But why don't you worry me
Or why do you go to sleep
Aren't you just with me that
This little child is okay for her searching

Why don't you worry me
And why do you go to sleep
I thought I am but simple
So simple to dream

Why do you worry me
Why don't you go to sleep
Aren't you confident that, everyone
Is Okay in the city

Why do you worry me
Why don't you go to sleep
I thought I am but simple
So simple to dream

I thought I am but simple, so simple to...
